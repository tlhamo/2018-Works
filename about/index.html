		<p> Tashidelek and Namaste! My name is Tseki Lhamo and I am a student at Mount Holyoke College of the class
			of 2020.
			<b>Where is home for you?</b>
			Nepal is home for me as I was born and brought up there. However I have spent the majority
			of my time studying in a boarding school located in the foothills of the Himalayas. So I would
			also regard India like my second home.
				
			<b>Why did you choose to come to Mount Holyoke College?</b>
		As a well accredited woman's college, I was interested in studying in an environment that encourages
		and motivates female representation in a variety of fields. I never thought I would be studying in a 
		woman's college but now that I am, I can definetly say that I have learned a lot of new ways of seeing
		things. 
			<b>What do you hope to major in?</b>
			I've always been fascinated by computer science and it's presence in almost everything that we 
			use nowadays. Computer Science was alien to me throughtout my years in highschool as we were 
			never offered programming classes. However looking back, I do remember doing basic computer science
			with the Scratch software. 
			
			<b>What comouter science projects have you developed?</b>
			Through my courses at Mount Holyoke, I have made various games like Tetris, MineSweepter etc.
